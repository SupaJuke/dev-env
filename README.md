4. VSC

## Requirements
TODO

## TODO
- install dependencies for `apt` (Ubuntu)
- copy p10k configuration (and maybe for each OS -- linux/mac)
- make VSC configuration more refined
- file line for NERDTree
- write 1 shell script that will call everything in order
- latex installation (for both mac and linux)
- clean install vs existing install? (for example vimplug should only be installed when clean install)

	- coc
	- coc-tabnine
	- fzf (on nvim)
